# Proposition Validity

This package contains all code used to have LLM role-play as a logician and perform a series of classification tasks to determine if each proposition is an imperative, interrogative, incomplete, or vague statement. These LLM-generated labels are treated as draft labels which need to be subsequently verified or modified by a human.
